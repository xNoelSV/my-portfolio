Welcome to **Matheorite**, an exciting project that my partner and I developed over the course of 3 months as a crucial part of our Higher Education degree! This game, centered on mathematical adventure in space, represents a significant milestone in our academic training, with substantial weight in our final grade.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The main objective of "Matheorite" is to offer an educational and entertaining gaming experience that combines the excitement of a space game with mathematical problem-solving. Throughout different levels, players face mathematical challenges to advance through the plot and defeat the Matheorites, space invaders.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Unity 2D**: Used as the main engine for game development, providing solid tools for creating 2D environments and implementing game logic

- **C#**: The primary programming language for Unity 2D, used for implementing game mechanics, logic, and interaction between elements

- **Collaborative Design**: We worked closely together to design and create the game's graphics, sounds, and levels. Constant communication was key to ensuring project coherence and quality

## ðŸ“š Learning Values

This "Matheorite" project has been an enriching experience that has contributed to the development of technical and personal skills:

### 1. Effective Collaboration

Close collaboration has been essential, ensuring that our skills complement each other and that the game's vision remains coherent.

### 2. Pair Project Management

Coordinating tasks, setting deadlines, and overcoming challenges together has strengthened our project management skills in a collaborative environment.

### 3. Commitment to Education

Creating an educational game involves a constant commitment to the quality and relevance of the mathematical problems presented.

### 4. Shared Responsibility

Shared responsibility in all aspects of the project has fostered a sense of mutual responsibility and commitment.

### 5. Learning Through Play

"Matheorite" is not just a game, but also an educational tool. We learned to balance gaming fun with teaching effectiveness.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

To enjoy "Matheorite", follow these simple steps:

1. Download the installation file from the repository
2. Install the game on your device
3. Embark on a mathematical adventure in space and destroy all the meteorites

Thank you for exploring "Matheorite". This game represents our joint effort, creativity, and dedication. We hope you enjoy the educational and gaming experience we've created with such enthusiasm!
