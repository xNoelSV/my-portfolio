Congratulations on reaching the end of this exciting individual project I developed over the last 3 months during my Higher Education degree! This project is a web application designed to facilitate booking management for a barbershop. With a reactive approach, I employed technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to deliver a dynamic and efficient user experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The main objective of this project was to create a web application that simplifies the booking process at a barbershop. From appointment scheduling by clients to efficient reservation management by barbershop staff, I aimed to improve efficiency and user experience in the context of appointment management.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the basic structure of the web page, ensuring accessibility and usability

- **CSS**: Implemented for the application's design and styling, creating an attractive and user-friendly interface

- **JavaScript**: Provides interactivity and client-side logic, enhancing user experience by performing dynamic actions without page reloads

- **PHP**: Employed for server-side logic, processing and storing reservation information. Additionally, it facilitates communication with the database

- **Responsive Design**: The application has been designed responsively, ensuring compatibility with different devices and screen sizes. This guarantees a consistent and pleasant experience on both desktop computers and mobile devices

## ðŸ“š Learning Values

This project, completed individually over a 3-month period, has been more than just a technical application. It has represented growth and development of valuable skills:

### 1. Autonomy and Self-Management

The ability to work independently, manage my time, and prioritize tasks has been significantly strengthened.

### 2. Fast and Efficient Development

The 3-month deadline demanded development efficiency, promoting a mindset of rapid delivery and iterative development.

### 3. Resilience in the Face of Challenges

In an individual project, facing technical challenges and overcoming obstacles required resilience and determination to achieve effective solutions.

### 4. Commitment to Quality

The responsibility for every aspect of the project has promoted a constant commitment to code quality, design, and user experience.

### 5. Deep and Rapid Learning

The need to learn new technologies and adapt quickly has been constant, fostering deep and rapid learning.
