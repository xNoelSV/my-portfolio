This repository contains all the code, exercises, and mini-projects I've written while taking the **"Master Spring framework, Spring Boot, REST, JPA, Hibernate"** course. It's a hands-on log of everything I've learned while diving deep into the Spring ecosystem.

## 📚 About the Course

The course focuses on building full-fledged web applications and RESTful APIs using technologies like:

- Spring Framework (Core, MVC, AOP)
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Spring JDBC & Spring Data JPA
- Thymeleaf
- Hibernate
- REST API Development & Consumption
- Spring Boot Actuator & Admin
- AWS Deployment
