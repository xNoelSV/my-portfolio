This repository contains three different APIs developed in Node.js, each with its own functionality and features. The APIs provide services for a blog, a social network, and a Spotify-like application.

## üìö Included APIs

### 1. Blog API

This API enables article management for a blog. Users can create, read, update, and delete articles.

### 2. Social Network API

This API provides functionalities for a social network. It allows user management, posts, and user following. Additionally, it introduces JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to ensure operation security.

### 3. Spotify-like Application API

This API simulates the main features of a music application like Spotify. It enables management of playlists, artists, songs, and more.

## üõ† Common Features

- **Node.js:** All APIs are developed using Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express:** The Express framework is used to simplify API development and manage routes and HTTP requests
- **Database:** Each API uses a database to store and manage data. MongoDB is the preferred database for these projects
- **API Documentation:** Each API includes detailed documentation describing available endpoints, request parameters, expected responses, and usage examples

## üìã Requirements

- Node.js installed on the system
- npm (Node Package Manager)
