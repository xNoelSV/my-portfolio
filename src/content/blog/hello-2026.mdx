# Hello 2026

New year, fresh calendar, same person - just a little more experienced, a little more humble, and (hopefully) a little kinder.

I like using January 1st for something simple: a reset of intention. Not a dramatic "new me", but a clear reminder of what I want to keep doing, and how I want to do it.

## What I'm carrying into this year

- Curiosity, even when the topic is hard or unfamiliar.
- Ownership, especially when something breaks and it's tempting to look away.
- Craft, because details are where trust is earned.
- Team energy, because the best work is almost never a solo act.
- Integrity, because long-term relationships matter more than short-term wins.

## A note for the people who evaluate candidates

If you work in recruiting or HR: thank you.

I've realized how much care goes into building teams - reading between the lines of a CV, balancing potential with experience, creating fair processes, replying to nervous students, and keeping everything moving with a human touch.

Behind every "candidate" there's a person doing their best with the information and time they have. When that effort is met with respect, it changes everything.

## My wish for 2026 (for you and for me)

I hope we all get to do work that:

- solves real problems,
- makes life a bit easier for someone else,
- and teaches us something we didn't know yesterday.

And if the year gets heavy (because it will, sometimes), I hope we remember this: progress isn't always loud. Sometimes it's just showing up again, one more day.

Happy New Year. Let's build good things.
