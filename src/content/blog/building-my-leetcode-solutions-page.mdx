# Building my LeetCode solutions page

For a long time, solving LeetCode problems felt like something you _do_, but don’t really _keep_. You solve a problem, maybe learn something, and then move on.

I didn’t want that anymore.

So I decided to build a dedicated page on my portfolio where I document the problems I solve, how I approached them, what I got wrong, and what I learned along the way.

Not as a leaderboard.  
Not as a flex.  
But as a learning tool.

## Why I’m doing this

I’ve noticed something: when I only solve problems in silence, I forget most of what I learned after a few days.

But when I write things down — the reasoning, the mistakes, the patterns — they stick.

This page is my attempt to:

- Turn practice into long-term knowledge.
- Make my thinking explicit.
- Track my evolution over time.
- And share the process, not just the result.

If future-me gets stuck on something I’ve already learned, this page is for him too.

## What each solution includes

I don’t want this to be a dump of code. That’s useless.

Each problem entry focuses on:

- The core idea of the solution.
- The data structure or algorithmic pattern involved.
- Why a naive approach fails.
- What I misunderstood at first.
- How I think about similar problems now.

Sometimes the explanation matters more than the code.

## How I implemented it

From a technical point of view, I wanted something simple, readable, and scalable.

Each solution is its own entry. I can:

- Add new problems easily.
- Link them directly.
- Tag them by topic later if I want.
- And keep everything consistent.

This way, the page grows naturally with my learning.

No pressure. No perfection. Just progress.

## What I’m learning from this (so far)

The biggest lesson hasn’t been about algorithms.

It’s been about _thinking_.

Writing forces me to slow down. To question my assumptions. To notice patterns. To admit when I didn’t understand something the first time.

And that’s where real learning happens.

## This is not a tutorial site

I’m not pretending to teach the world.

This is a public notebook.

If someone else finds it useful, that’s amazing.  
If not, it still does its job: helping me become a better engineer.

This page will evolve. My explanations will improve. My solutions will get cleaner.

And that’s the whole point.
