# Online Assessment submitted

Today I got the email I was hoping for: my Amazon Online Assessment is officially submitted.

A few days ago I received the assessment reminder and a unique link to start it. Today, after a quiet evening, a big glass of water, and way too many deep breaths, I clicked submit. Now it's out of my hands - and that feels surprisingly good.

## What this step means (for me)

Getting invited to an OA doesn't mean "you're in", but it *does* mean Amazon saw something in my application worth testing further. For a student, that's already a win.

I'm sharing this because I like documenting these moments - the messy middle, not only the final result.

## How I approached it (without breaking any rules)

I won't talk about specific questions, but I *can* share what helped me keep my head straight:

- I treated it like a real work session. Clean desk, headphones, notifications off.
- I wrote down a tiny plan before starting. Timeboxes, checkpoints, and "if I get stuck, do X".
- I focused on clarity first. A correct, readable solution beats a clever one you can't finish.
- I kept notes of mistakes. Not for the OA - for me. Patterns matter.

If you're reading this and you have an OA coming up: you don't need magic. You need a calm environment, decent fundamentals, and a simple plan.

## What I learned (even if I never hear back)

This was a good reminder that interviews aren't only about "being smart". They're about:

- staying composed when the clock is loud,
- making trade-offs and committing,
- communicating (even when it's just with yourself in your head).

And honestly... it also reminded me why I love building software. There's something satisfying about turning "I don't know yet" into "okay, I can do this".

## Next steps

Now I wait. If Amazon decides to move forward, I'll hear back. If not, I still walked away with a sharper idea of what to practice next.

Either way, I'm proud I showed up.

Notes to future me: sleep more, trust the basics, and don't overthink the first draft.
