# Interview stage... here we go

Yesterday I received an email from Amazon's university recruiting team: my application for Software Development Engineer Intern has moved to the interview stage.

That sentence hits different when you've been grinding quietly for months.

## The message (in plain words)

They told me they're impressed with my application and that there are internship opportunities aligned with candidates who can commit 5-6 months in Barcelona. The first thing they asked was simple:

> Are you available for a 5-6 month internship commitment?

I replied right away. Yes.

Next up: I've been told the process continues with **two remote interviews** (video calls). It's being coordinated by Amazon's university talent team, and it feels like the real deal now.

## What I'm doing now

This is the part where preparation becomes less "study more" and more "be intentional".

My plan for the coming days is boring - and that's the point:

- Data structures + algorithms refresh, but focusing on patterns (not random problems).
- Explaining out loud while coding. If I can't explain it, I don't really own it.
- Amazon Leadership Principles in STAR format. Not buzzwords - real stories, real impact.
- Mock interviews with friends (and ruthless note-taking afterwards).

## Two reminders I'm keeping close

1. Being interview-ready is a skill, not a personality trait. You can train it.
2. I don't need to be perfect - I need to be clear, structured, and honest about my thinking.

## Gratitude moment

I'm grateful for the people who've helped along the way - classmates, mentors, and the random internet strangers who write posts that make you feel less alone in this process.

This is one step. But it's a big one for me.

I'll share how the interviews go (without spilling anything confidential). For now: time to practice, sleep, and keep the nerves friendly.
